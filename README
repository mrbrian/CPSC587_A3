=== 3. ALGORITHMS and DESIGN DECISIONS: ===

I am using my own B-Spline implementation from a CPSC589 assignment.  The Main program is based off of the supplied CPSC587 animation sample code.

Bonus 1) A train of cars is rendered.
Bonus 2) First person view is implemented (use F1 key)
Bonus 3) For extra realism I added diffuse lighting to the shader and render shadows on the ground.
