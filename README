=== 1. EXECUTION: ===

To compile the program, on the terminal enter the following commands:

	make

To run the program, on the terminal enter the following command:

	./assign3

=== 2. PROGRAM USE: ===

	1  - Previous model scene
	2  - Next model scene

	+  - Increase time step 
	-  - Decrease time step
	W, A, S, D - Translate camera position
	Left Click & Drag - Rotate camera
	C - Reset camera orientation
	
	
=== 3. ALGORITHMS and DESIGN DECISIONS: ===

Scene 1 - Mass + spring
Scene 2 - Series of mass + springs
Scene 3 - Jello cube hitting a flat surface
Scene 4 - Hanging cloth
Scene 5 - Flag + wind 

Integration is done by semi-implicit Euler.  (Mass.cpp:36)
Default timestep is 1/60 sec.

Bonus:  
	Simulation of a flag in wind.  Smooth normals are calculated for each mass(vertex).  
	
	The force applied to each mass is:
		F = face.normal.dot(wind_force) * face.normal.
		
	I originally multiplied the dot product by the wind direction but some of the vertices on the top
	of the flag were drooping(from no lifting force).  
	
	Basic electrostatic forces have been implemented on the flag: (Model5.cpp:132)	
	This is limited to masses within a certain distance of each other to improve speed.
		F = unit_vector_between_masses * constant * charge1 * charge2 / dist^2 
	
	To make the wind less uniform, the force is scaled by sin(time_counter).  (Model5.cpp:153)
